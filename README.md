# Reflow
## A lightweight, opinionated workflow cli for React

The impetus for creating this tool was a desire to generate components, pages, hooks, reducers, and test files for the following react app directory stucture:

```
src
	components
	pages
	styles
	__tests__
	hooks
	reducers
	App.js
	...
```

### Coming Soon

1. Components
	- To generate component files and styles for COMPONENT_NAME, fork the files locally and execute `make_component COMPONENT_NAME` from the root of your react project directory.

2. Pages

3. Hoooks

4. Reducers
