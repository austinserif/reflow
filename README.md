# Reflow
## A lightweight, opinionated workflow cli for React

The impetus for creating this tool was a desire to generate components, pages, hooks, reducers, and test files for the following react app directory stucture:

```
src
	components
	pages
	styles
	__tests__
	hooks
	reducers
	App.js
	...
```

### Quick Start

To generate a new page or component, navigate to the root directory or your react app and execute one of following:

1. Components: `/path/to/reflow/make-react component Nav Routes`

2. Pages `/path/to/reflow/make-react page Home About`

### Coming Soon

3. Hooks

4. Reducers
